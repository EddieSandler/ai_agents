# Python program to calculate the first 10,000 terms of the series 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ...
n_terms = 10000
total_sum = 0

# Calculate the series
for n in range(n_terms):
    term = (-1) ** n / (2 * n + 1)  # calculate each term
    total_sum += term  # add the term to the total sum

# Multiply the sum by 4
final_result = total_sum * 4

# Print the result
print(final_result)

# Output:
# 3.1414926535900345
